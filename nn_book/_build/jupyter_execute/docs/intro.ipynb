Both the explanations of key concepts of neural networks and the illustrative programs are kept at a very elementary \"high-school\" level. The code, made very simple, is described in detail. Moreover, is is written without any use of higher-level libraries for neural networks, which brings in better understanding of the explaned algorithms and shows how to program them from scratch. "

    "Inspiration for computational mathematical models discussed in this course originates from the biological structure of our neural system. The central nervous system (the brain) contains a huge number ($\\sim 10^{11}$) of [neurons](https://human-memory.net/brain-neurons-synapses/), which may viewed as tiny elementary processor units. They receive signal via the dendrites, and in case it is strong enough, the nucleus decides (a computation done here!) to \"fire\" an output signal along the axon, where it is subsequently passed via axon terminals to dendrites of other neurons. The axon-dendrite connections (the synaptic connections) may be weak or strong, modifying the stimulus. Moreover, the strength of the synaptic connections may change in time ([Hebbian rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) tels that the connections get stronger if they are being used repeatedly). In this sense, the neuron is \"programmable\". \n"

    "We may ask ourselves if the number of neurons in the brain should really be labeled so \"huge\" as usually claimed. Let us compare it to the computing devices which memory chips. The number of $10^{11}$ neurons roughly correspond to the number of transistors in a 10GB memory chip, which does not impress us so much, as these days we may buy such chips for 2\\$ or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the speed of traveling of the nerve impulses, which is due to electrochemical processes, is not impresive, either. Fastest signals, such as those related to muscle positioning, travel at speeds up to 120m/s (the myelin sheaths are essential to achieve them). The touch signals reach about 80m/s, whereas pain is transmitted only at comparatively very slow speeds of 0.6m/s. This is the reason why when you drop a hammer on your toe, you sense it immediately, but the pain reaches your brain with a delay of ~1s, as it has to pass the distance of ~1.5m. On the other hand, in electronic devices the signal travels at the speed of light, $\\sim 300000{\\rm km/s}=3\\times 10^{8}{\\rm m/s}$!\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, the average [reaction time](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/reactiontime) is 0.25s to a visual stimulus, 0.17s for an audio stimulus, and 0.15s for a touch. Thus setting the threshold time for a false start in sprints at 0.1s is safely below a possible reaction of a runner. These are very slow reactions compared to electronic responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the energy consumption of the brain, one can estimate that on the average a cortical neuron [fires](https://aiimpacts.org/rate-of-neuron-firing/) about once per 6 seconds. Likewise, it is unlikely that an average cortical neuron fires more than once per second. Multplying the above firing rate by the number of all the cortical neurons, $\\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{10}$, yields about $3 \\times 10^{9}$ firings/s in the cortex, or 3GHz. This is the rate of a typical processor chip! So if a firing is identified with an elementary calculation, the combined power of the brain is comparable to that of standart computer processor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above facts indicate that, from a point of view of naive comparisons with silicon-based chips, the human brain is nothing so special. So what is it that gives us our unique abilities: amazing visual and audio pattern recognition, thinking, consciousness, intuition, imagination? The answer is linked to an amazing architecture of the brain, where each neuron (processor unit) is connected via synapses to, on the average, 10000 (!) other neurons (cf. Fig. {numref}`sample-fig`). This feature makes it radically different and immensely more complicated than the architecture consisting of the control unit, processor, and memory in our computers (the von Neumann machine). There, the number of connections is of the order of the number of bits of memory. In contrast, there are about $10^{15}$ synaptic connections in the human brain. As mentioned, the connections may be \"programmed\" to get stronger or weaker. If, for he sake of a simple estimate, we approximated the connection strength by just two states of a synapse, 0 or 1, the total number of combinatorial configurations of such a system would be $2^{10^{15}}$ - a humongous number. Most of such confiburation, of course, never realize in practice, nevertheless the number of possible configuration states of the brain, or the \"programs\" it can run, is immense."

The complexity of the network and the tasks it may accomplish increases with the number of layers and the number of neurons in the layers. Networks with one layer of neurons are called **single-layer** networks. The last layer (light blue blobs) is called the **output layer**. In multi-layer networks the layers preceding the output layer (purple blobs) are called **intermediate layers**. If the number of layers is large (e.g. as many as 64, 128, ...), we deal with **deep networks**.\n",

As we will describe in detail in the next chapter, the signal is appropriately processeded by the neurons. \n",
