# Explaining neural networks in raw Python: <br> lectures in Jupiter

[**Institute of Nuclear Physics PAN**](https://www.ifj.edu.pl), Kraków, and

[**Jan Kochanowski University**](https://www.ujk.edu.pl), Kielce, Poland

These lectures were originally given to undergraduate students of computer engineering at the [Jan Kochanowski University](https://www.ujk.edu.pl) in Kielce, Poland, and for
the [Kraków School of Interdisciplinary PhD Studies](https://kisd.ifj.edu.pl/news/). They explain the very basic concepts of neural networks at a most elementary level, requiring only very rudimentary knowledge of Python, or actually any programming language. With simplicity in mind, the code for various algorithms of neural networks is written from absolute scratch, i.e. without any use of dedicated higher-level libraries. That way one can follow all the programming steps in an explicit manner.

```{important}
The text is brief (the pdf version has only ~130 pages), so a diligent student can complete the course in a few afternoons!
```

```{note}
Built with [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  
```

```{important}
The reader may download the book codes in the form of 
[jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks from ... 

{ref}`app-lab` explains step-by-step how to run the book codes.
