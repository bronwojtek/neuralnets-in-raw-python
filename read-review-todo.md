### General
* Links should open in a new tab

### Intro
* Feed-forward network is described too vaguely, discuss online
* Explanation for using Python, consider not quoting Tim Peters, instead emphasize Python's strengths in data science
* "How to use this book" section is missing, discuss online

### MCP
* "# step function (also in neural library package)" - vague comment
* `This is one of possible boolean functions of two arguments (in total, we have 16 different functions of this kind, why?).`
  It's bit unclear what "functions of this kind" refer to and whether the question is aimed to the reader for self-reflection. 
  `we have` is also a bit confusing - it can refer to code library, "in total, it's possible to construct 16..." does not have this ambiguity.
