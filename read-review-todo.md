### General
* Links should open in a new tab

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
### Intro
* Feed-forward network is described too vaguely, discuss online
* Explanation for using Python, consider not quoting Tim Peters, instead emphasize Python's strengths in data science
* "How to use this book" section is missing, discuss online

### MCP
* "# step function (also in neural library package)" - vague comment
* w0 = -b introduces sign inconsistency
* neuron() function docs specifies x and w vector as the same length. In reality, len(x)+1 = len(w)
